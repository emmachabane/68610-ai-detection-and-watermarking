41,"In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the eyes to change their response to a changed visual environment. It is a physiological process that underlies the detection and interpretation of images by the brain.

Adaptation is an important process in vision because it enables us to detect objects and scenes that are changing rapidly, such as when we are moving or when something new is happening. Our eyes usually adapt quickly to changes in our environment, but sometimes they can't adapt fast enough or they adapt in the wrong way. This can lead to problems with our vision, like when we can't see in low light or when we get headaches from viewing bright lights.

There are two main types of adaptation: positive and negative. Positive adaptation occurs when the eyes become more sensitive to light, and negative adaptation occurs when the eyes become less sensitive to light.","In visual physiology , adaptation is the ability of the eyes to shift their response to a altered visual surroundings .

170,"Figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. The term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.

Figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. For instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. If, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.

In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. Large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. Conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.

Figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. For instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map. By contrasting large areas with small areas, cartographers can help to improve legibility.","Figure - ground comparison , in the context of mapmaking , is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a mapping and the spaces around them .

Hanushek has written extensively on economics, education, and policy issues. He is best known for his work in labor economics, which has focused on the determinants of wages and employment in both the United States and other countries. His most influential work has demonstrated that while there are many factors that determine wages and employment levels, human capital (i.e., skills) is a dominant determinant of wage levels. Furthermore, Hanushek has demonstrated that while government intervention can improve employment opportunities and wages for low-income groups, it typically does not have a large impact on the wages or employment levels of high-income individuals or groups.

186,"The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as capers, is a family of flowering plants in the order Capitatae. The family is subdivided into two subfamilies, Capparinae and Capreolinae. There are about 165 genera and 2,000 species of capers, distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical climates.

The capers are a terrestrial or semiterrestrial family of flowering plants. They are herbs or small shrubs, with fleshy leaves that are either alternate or opposite and entire or toothed.

It was formerly known as the viola da gamba de quarta corda, because the fourth string of the viola da gamba is tuned a fourth lower than the other strings. The name ""viola da Terceira"" was introduced in the 18th century. The viola da Terceira is commonly used in classical music, chamber music and as a solo instrument.

436,"Quda'a (/ALA-LC: Quḍāʿa) were a group of sedentary Arab nomads who inhabited the southern Syrian Desert during the pre-Islamic period.

The exact origins of the Quda'a are not known with certainty, but it is generally believed that they originated from Yemen or from Central Arabia. They are thought to have migrated southwards in the late 2nd century AD or early 3rd century AD, and to have settled in what is now the Syrian Desert. There is evidence to suggest that they were partly responsible for the diffusion of a number of religious and cultural practices into southern Syria.

The Quda'a are known to have been particularly active in the trade in goods such as frankincense, myrrh, and gold. They also appear to have been involved in agriculture, herding camel herds, and mining. The Quda'a were also known for their piety and their adherence to a number of religious beliefs, including Islam.

439,"The vinyl revival, also known as the analog revival, is a resurgence of interest in vinyl records as a playback medium, mainly among audiophiles and music collectors. The reasons for the renewed interest are manifold, but include the fact that vinyl records are not subject to the technological advances that have led to digital music files being the dominant format for music consumption, vinyl records have a higher sound quality than most digital formats, and vinyl records can be played on turntables that are not usually used for music playback.

The first vinyl revival occurred in the early 1970s when large-scale production of LPs restarted in the United States after a decade-long decline for several reasons. The rise of punk rock in the late 1970s created a demand for new and used LPs, which were less available on CD at that time. Additionally, the advent of MTV in the early 1980s helped spur record sales by exposing new listeners to old LPs they might not have heard before.

The second vinyl revival began in the early 2000s and has been most notable in Europe and Japan. This revival was spurred by technological advances that made it possible to play vinyl records on turntables that were not usually used for music playback.

The Newell–Daganzo merge model is a mathematical model that is used to understand the behavior of traffic streams that are merging into one. The model accounts for the interactions between the traffic streams, and it can be used to predict the behavior of the combined traffic stream.

The Newell–Daganzo merge model is based on the concept of flow separation. In theory, flow separation occurs when two or more traffic streams are able to remain separate from each other. However, in practice, flow separation is rarely achieved and is instead replaced by flow merging.

Flow merging occurs when two or more traffic streams are forced to merge together. This process can be difficult and can lead to congestion on the roads. The Newell–Daganzo merge model is designed to help us understand how flow merging affects the behavior of the combined traffic stream.

590,"In macroeconomics, the classical dichotomy is the distinction between market and planned economies. It is based on the differing assumptions made about the behavior of economic agents under market and planning conditions.

In a market economy, agents are assumed to be rational and self-interested. They will seek to maximize their profits, and will act in their own best interests. The allocation of resources will be determined by the interactions between these agents.

In a planned economy, agents are assumed to be committed to the common good. They will aim to fulfill the needs of the population as a whole, rather than focusing on individual profit. Planning decisions are based on a understanding of the future needs of society, rather than on current economic conditions.

The classical dichotomy has been challenged by recent research which suggests that there is little difference between market and planned economies in terms of their impact on social welfare.","In macroeconomics , the classical dichotomy is the distinction between market and planned economies .

694,"In basketball, a technical foul (colloquially known as a ""tech"") is a penalty assessed to a player by the referee for unsportsmanlike conduct. A technical foul is one of several penalties available to the referee, which can be called for various reasons, such as ball-stopping, arguing with the referee, or physical contact with an opponent. In some cases, when a technical foul is called against a player who is already in violation of the rules, that player will be assessed another technical foul.

720,"Ballet as a music form progressed from its origins in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century to become one of the most prominent and renowned art forms in the world. While ballet initially served as an accompaniment to song, it developed into its own distinct genre, characterized by its choreography, music and dramatic elements.

In the early days of ballet, courtly performances were accompanied by music played on pipe organs or harpsichords. As courtly dances grew more elaborate and intricate, however, their accompanying music became too difficult for courtiers to play. This led to the development of an entirely new form of ballet music, known as chamber ballet. Chamber ballet was typically performed by a small group of dancers accompanied only by string instruments such as violins or cellos.

As ballet grew in popularity and complexity, it began to be performed in larger venues with a wider range of accompanying musicians. This led to the creation of opera ballets, which featured lavish sets and costumes and extended dance scenes that could take up entire performances. Opera ballets were typically performed by large castes of actors and dancers who wore elaborate costumes and makeup.

Today, ballet is one of the most popular forms of art in the world. It is widely enjoyed by people of all ages, and is often used as an educational tool in schools.

730,"Allan Arthur Pearse (22 April 1915 – 21 May 1915) was an Irish poet and playwright. He was the younger brother of Patrick Pearse and the uncle of Seán Pearse.

Allan Pearse was born in Rathmines, Dublin on 22 April 1915, the son of Arthur and Bridget (née Hickey) Pearse. He was the younger brother of Patrick Pearse and the uncle of Seán Pearse. Allan attended Rathmines School from 1912 to 1917, and then studied at Trinity College, Dublin from 1917 to 1920.

In 1921, Allan founded the journal ""Fianna Éireann"", which he edited until 1923. That year he also wrote and directed his first play, ""The Plough and the Stars"". The play was not well received by audiences or critics, but it has since been seen as a significant work in Irish theatre. In 1924, he married Mary Clarke.

Pearse's poetry is characterised by its dense language and its romanticism of Irish nationalism. His best-known work is the short poem ""Easter 1916"", which commemorates the Easter Rising that took place two years earlier. On Easter Monday 1916, Pearse and fellow rebel leaders James Connolly and Éamon de Valera were executed by the British authorities for their part in Ireland's independence movement.

731,"Length of pull (sometimes abbreviated as LOP) is the distance between the grip surface and the butt of a firearm.

Length of pull is important for two reasons. The first reason is that it affects the balance of a firearm. A firearm with a shorter LOP will be more stable in the hand, while a firearm with a longer LOP will be less stable. The second reason is that it affects how easily the firearm can be pulled back. A shorter LOP will require more effort to pull back the firearm, while a longer LOP will allow for easier pulling.","Length of pull ( commonly abbreviated as LOP ) is the distance between the grip surface and the butt of a firearm .

The song was generally well received by music critics. Critics praised its catchiness and dance-floor appeal, while also noting its feminist message.

Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that focusses on the use of cirques to prove properties about mathematical expressions. Cirquent calculus was developed by Simon Polak and is described in his thesis ""Cirquent Calculus: A New Proof Language and its Applications"" (PDF). cirques are a type of looping structure often found in mathematics and computer science, used to represent recursive functions. In cirquent calculus, a cirque is used to represent a function that takes one input and returns another input. The function can be represented as a set of nested loops, where each loop contains the input and output of the previous loop.

One of the main benefits of using cirques to represent functions is that they can be easily mapped onto structural equation models (SEM). SEMs are a popular tool for predicting the outcomes of complex interactions between variables. By mapping cirques onto SEMs, it is possible to automatically determine the effects of changes to the variables on the outcome. This allows for more accurate predictions than would be possible with traditional methods.

Another benefit of using cirques to represent functions is that they provide a compact way to represent recursive functions. By compactly representing recursive functions,","Cirquent calculus is a proof logic that focusses on the using of cirques to prove properties about mathematical expressions .

913,"Perryella is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian theropod dinosaur that lived in the Late Cretaceous Period, about 80 million years ago. It was a small, slender dvinosaurian, with a long tail and a small head. It was the only known member of its genus.

Perryella was first described by American palaeontologist Charles Whitney in 1927. The type specimen, NHMUK R.5337, is a partial skeleton that consists of the skull, forelimbs, and hindlimbs. It is missing the front legs and most of the tail. The skeleton was discovered in the Isle of Wight in southern England.

Perryella is a diminutive dvinosaurian, measuring only 2 metres (6.6 feet) long and weighing about 40 kilograms (88 pounds). Its skeleton is relatively undeveloped for its size, with only the skull and some skeletal elements preserved. Despite its small size, Perryella had a long tail and a small head. Its teeth were supplemented by serrated blades on the jaws, which may have been used to eat meat.

Despite its small size and undeveloped skeleton, Perryella is one of the most primitive dvinosaurs known. It shares many features with other primitive dvinosaurs such as Allosaurus fragilis and Sinraptor ostrommaysorum, which suggests that it was an early member of this group of dinosaurs.
