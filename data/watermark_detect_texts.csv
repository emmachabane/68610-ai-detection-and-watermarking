"In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the eyes to change their response to a changed visual environment. It is a physiological process that underlies the detection and interpretation of images by the brain.

Adaptation is an important process in vision because it enables us to detect objects and scenes that are changing rapidly, such as when we are moving or when something new is happening. Our eyes usually adapt quickly to changes in our environment, but sometimes they can't adapt fast enough or they adapt in the wrong way. This can lead to problems with our vision, like when we can't see in low light or when we get headaches from viewing bright lights.

There are two main types of adaptation: positive and negative.

"Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method of transferring development rights in a project from the original developer to another party. The term is most commonly used in the context of real estate development.

The purpose of TDR is to provide a way for the original developer to relinquish control of a project without having to sell the property or give up any ownership rights. This can be useful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the property.

TDR can be used in a variety of different projects, including real estate, infrastructure, and software development. Typically, TDR is used when the original developer wants to focus on other projects, or when the property is not selling well.

There are a number of different methods for transferring TDRs. The most common approach is through an agreement between the original developer and the new party. Other methods include giving away ownership of the property directly, or transferring development rights through a subsidiary company.

There are several advantages to using TDRs. First, it can provide a way for the original developer to exit a project without having to give up any ownership rights. This can be helpful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the project.

"Figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. The term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.

Figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. For instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. If, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.

In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. Large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. Conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.

Figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. For instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map. By contrasting large areas with small areas, cartographers can help to improve legibility.","Figure-ground contrast, in the context oof the study, is the ratio of the image intensities of two different objects at different distances, e.g. the ratio of the intensities of two different objects at different wavelengths of light, e.g. the ratio of the intensities",kirch,,,TRUE,,,,,,
