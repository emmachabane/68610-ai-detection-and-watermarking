41,"In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the eyes to change their response to a changed visual environment. It is a physiological process that underlies the detection and interpretation of images by the brain.

Adaptation is an important process in vision because it enables us to detect objects and scenes that are changing rapidly, such as when we are moving or when something new is happening. Our eyes usually adapt quickly to changes in our environment, but sometimes they can't adapt fast enough or they adapt in the wrong way. This can lead to problems with our vision, like when we can't see in low light or when we get headaches from viewing bright lights.

There are two main types of adaptation: positive and negative. Positive adaptation occurs when the eyes become more sensitive to light, and negative adaptation occurs when the eyes become less sensitive to light.","The adaptation of the eyes to changes in their environment is a crucial process in visual physiology, which is fundamental to the brain's ability to recognize and interpret rapidly changing images and scenes.

170,"Figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. The term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.

Figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. For instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. If, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.

In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. Large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. Conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.

Figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. For instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map. By contrasting large areas with small areas, cartographers can help to improve legibility.","The distinction between the shapes and sizes of features on a map's surface and the spaces surrounding them is known as ground comparison in mapmaking. This term typically refers to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps that contain abstract concepts.
